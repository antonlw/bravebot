I had similar issue it turned out be that the supporting libraries that you used were 
installed as a different user (in my case pi user), which root did not "see" or were in root's path. 
A simple test went to run them as sudo (which simulates running as root) i got this error.
sudo -H -u user /absolute/path/of/python/executable /absolute/path/to/python/program
